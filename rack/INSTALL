RACK

'RACK' is a C++ based program for weather radar data processing. It supports
quality control of measurement volumes, product generation and compositing, for
example. The program works on command line; there is no graphical interface.


PREREQUISITES

The package has been developed with Eclipse IDE.
The involved Makefile and its components (*.d, and *.mk) are stored in make.zip. 

Three libraries are required:

      Hdf5	 (libhdf5.so)	HDF5 file support
      Png    (libpng12.so)	png image files
      Proj4  (libproj.so)	geographic projections  

Optionally:

      GeoTIFF (libtiff.so, libgeotiff.so)  Support for geolocated output images  

In many systems the general libraries can be installed for example
as follows:

  sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev libpng12-dev libproj-dev  libtiff4-dev


DOWNLOADING RACK

COMPILATION

1. Run ./configure.sh
   Edit the resulting install-rack.cnf if needed.
   
2. Run ./build.sh
   The command unzips make.zip to Release/ directory and calls 'make all'
   there. 


After successful build, the script will prompt for a directory for installing
the binary. If hdf5 or sz libraries raise errors, ensure that both libraries
are available, for example with

  export LD_RUN_PATH=$LD_RUN_PATH:/var/opt/lib

The default version has image file I/O support for PNG only.
For GeoTIFF support,

If you encounter compilation problems after installing several versions,
issue "make clean-all" and retry.
