Installation
=================

**Rack** is a C++ based program for weather radar data processing. It supports
quality control of measurement volumes, product generation and compositing, for
example. The program works on command line; there is no graphical interface.


Prerequisites
-------------

Three libraries are required:

* Hdf5   (libhdf5.so)	HDF5 data files
* Png    (libpng12.so)	png image files
* Proj4  (libproj.so)	geographic projections  

Optionally:

* GeoTIFF (libtiff.so, libgeotiff.so)  geolocated image files (output)

In many systems the general libraries can be installed for example
as follows:

```bash
  sudo apt-cache search libhdf-dev 
```


If those version are not found, try
```bash
 serial
/usr/include/hdf5/serial/
Save previous value, if not found

CC in conf
```


The package has been developed with Eclipse IDE. Makefile and its components
(*.d, and *.mk) generated by the IDE are stored in make.gtz. 



Downloading
-----------

* Latest version: https://github.com/fmidev/rack
* Old version:    http://baltrad.fmi.fi/software/rack/download.html

Command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fmidev/rack.git
```


Compilation
-----------

After donwloading the code, move to rack/src/ directory and:

1. Run `./configure.sh`  
   Edit the resulting install-rack.cnf if needed.
   
2. Run `./build.sh`  
   The command unzips make.zip to Release/ directory and calls 'make all' there. 
   If you encounter compilation problems after installing several versions,
   issue `./build.sh clean` and rerun `./build.sh`.

3. Run `./install.sh`  
   In success, the script will also prompt for copying utility scripts in
   the same target directory

If hdf5 or sz libraries raise errors upon invocation of Rack, ensure that
both libraries are available, for example with

```
  export LD_RUN_PATH=$LD_RUN_PATH:/var/opt/lib
```


Note on Eclipse settings
------------------------

Rack has been developed using *Eclipse IDE*, with the following settings.

### Prequisites

Install standard C++ tools and the libraries required by Rack. For example:
```
apt install git make g++ 
apt install 
```

Download (clone) the Rack software in a temporary directory, for example:
```
clone https://github.com/fmidev/rack.git ~/rack-git
```

### All configurations

* Create project "rack": C++ Managed Build, Executable, Empty
* Exit Eclipse
* Move code to Eclipse project dir. For example: `mv ~/rack-git/* ~/rack-git/.git ~/eclipse-workspace/rack/`
* Restart Eclipse and refresh (F5) "rack" project dir.

* Exclude "examples" and "demo" dirs from build.

**C++ linker**, libraries: 

* hdf5
* proj
* png 
* tiff, gtiff (optional)

### "Debug" configuration:

C++ Build/Settings/C++ Compiler/Includes: Include paths
```
${workspace_loc:}
```

C++ linker, library paths:
```
${workspace_loc:drain/Debug}
```

### "Release" configuration:

C++ build, environment (variables) or C++ preprocessor:
```
Defined symbols (-D) :
USE_GEOTIFF_${USE_GEOTIFF}
VT100
```



C++ compiler, include paths:
```
$$hdfroot/include
$$projroot/include
```

C/C++ Build, Environment:

Create variables:
|CCFLAGS|-std=gnu++11 -fopenmp -I/usr/include/geotiff -I/usr/include/hdf5/serial   -I/usr/include/libpng12   -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu  -I/usr/include/geotiff|
|LDFLAGS|-std=gnu++11 -fopenmp -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial -lhdf5 -lproj -lpng12 -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -ltiff  -lgeotiff|
|USE_GEOTIFF|YES| 

C++ compiler, misc options:
```
$$CCFLAGS
```

C++ linker, misc options:
```
$$LDFLAGS
```

C++ linker, library search paths:
```
$$hdfroot/lib
$$projroot/lib
```

Documentation
-------------

Online code documentation containing examples of usage is on https://fmidev.github.io/rack/

In addition, a PDF manual may be shipped with this file, or can be generated with

```bash
  cd demo
  ./make-tests.sh
  cd ..
  make doc      # For html version
  make doc-pdf  # For rack-doc.pdf
```
